Sorry for my title attracter, I am not comment anything about Mark Zuckerberg's generous. What I am really considering is:

> Is the money that the only point to make the earth a better place?

Why almost every time I hear almost everybody to start their charity with 
donating their property firstly. Which make us believe in that money can buy everything include human's happiness, and world's justice, and peace of earth.

Once I watched TED speech titled with "The real reason of poverty", which's theme is about violence factor to the poverty area.

This really make me rethink about the charity career around the world.

Is the real fair exist in the world?

Can a forever peaceful earth come to a reality for most human beings?

I do not know. What I know is, it's not easy at all.
