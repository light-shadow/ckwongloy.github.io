Sorry for my title attracter, I am not comment anything about Mark Zuckerberg's generous. What I am considering is:

> Is the money that the only point to make the earth a better place?

Why almost every time I hear almost everybody to start their charity with 
donating their property firstly. Which make us believe in that money can buy everything include human's happiness , and world's justice, and peace of earth.

Is the real fair exist in the world?
