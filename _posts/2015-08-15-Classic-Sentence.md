( Ngnix )

As of early 2015，we powered 24% of all web servers and almost half of the world's busiest sites.

The journey here has not been always  a smooth one.  

一路走来并不容易

As you’ll learn in this book, nginx is all of these things, but at the very core it’s an HTTP router, a living, breathing part of the web stack that gives developers the flexibility to build and deploy web apps easier than ever before. 

It lags behind any major feature development but gets critical bug fixes back ported to it. As of writing, the latest stable version is 1.6.2 

That being said, mainline is not bleeding edge. Many people choose to run mainline in production for new features.
