这是出自狄更斯《双城记》中一段发人深省的话，我觉得很有意思。

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,

It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of  foolishness,

It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,

It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,

It wasthe spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,

We had everything before us,we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all goingdirect the other way

-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
 
It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done;

it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
