这是出自狄更斯《双城记》中一段发人深省的话，我觉得很有意思。

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ;

这是最好的时代，这是最坏的时代；

> It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of  foolishness ;

这是智慧的年代，这是愚蠢的年代；

> It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity ;

这是信仰的时期，这是怀疑的时期；

> It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness ;

这是光明的季节，这是黑暗的季节；

> It wasthe spring of hope, it was the winter of despair ;

这是希望之春，这是绝望之冬；

> We had everything before us,we had nothing before us ;

我们拥有一切，我们一无所有；

> We were all going direct to Heaven, we were all goingdirect the other way。

我们正走向天堂，我们也在奔向地狱。

> In short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

简而言之，昔日与如今非常相像，某些最喧嚣的政权坚持要用形容词的最高级来形容它：说它好，是最高级的好；说它不好，也是最高级的差。

> It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done ;

这是一件，远比我曾经做过的，更好的事情；

> It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.

这是一场，远比我曾经听说过的，更好的宁静。
